# Data-Mining-project
This project applies data mining techniques to extract patterns and insights from large datasets. 
I analyzed the Recipe Reviews and User Feedback dataset, which includes 18,182 entries and 15 features using Python. Through classification and regression, the project identifies patterns in recipe feedback, predicts user sentiment from text, and extracts meaningful insights into user preferences and recipe quality.

This project showcases skills in data preprocessing, feature selection, and predictive modeling, as well as data analysis and numerical reasoning.
